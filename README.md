This was a team project (with the lovely Yalda Golshani - shoutout) for the 42Heilbronn coding school. The subject is the pdf in the repo. The project was compiled for a Mac.

We programmed a simple (16 commands) IRC server in C++ that can nevertheless be connected to one or several KVIrc clients.

I programmed the application layer and Yalda programmed the socket layer.
