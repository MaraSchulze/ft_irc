Substitute DFLAGS with CFLAGS in 2 rules for terminal submit!

what happens if sth goes wrong in the auth process? Should we disconnect?

we must implement that a command to a not registered user returns an error

There are users in inviteList and operators that are not correctly handeled if a user is kicked for instance!

Nick has only 9 chars
channel has certain syntax
command has certain syntax


----------------

nc -vc irc.uni-erlangen.de 6667

---------------

privmsg, mode without parameters, quit		check
What if mode change fails? Server message must be fitted accordingly.	check


channel must be deleted, if there is noone in it anymore.	 kinda check

----------------

commands, channel and nicks must be case insensitive	check

how is it with commands when not registered?	check

----------------

We need some mechanism to set back a client connection initiated from the ircApplicationLayer. The management of the data structures in Server.cpp is otherwise not right. There is an empty entry after a QUIT.
